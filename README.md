# PostSpiral

PostSpiral is a Letterloop clone, which aims to provide a **free**, **open-source** solution of a private group newsletters for friends.

## Principles

- Only English expressions in the source code
- Use snake case (some_thing) for own contribution
- Consider security, as any data on the server can be accessible from outside (due to HTTP protocol)
- Do not use Microsoft Windows in the development process (except as an SSH client)
- Use a testing branch for testing purposes, and the main branch for the stable release
- Aim for a solution, not a tool-kit (less modular, less options)
