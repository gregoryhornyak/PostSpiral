# Layout of the process

A1: **ASK** some questions
A2: **ANSWER** all questions
A3: **ABEYANCE** for some time
A4: **ADDRESS** the recipients
A5: **AGAIN**!

## Arising uncertainty

### A1:

- Are all the questions visible?
- Are duplicates allowed?
- What is the question length limit?
- How many questions oer person?
- Are questions anonymous?

### A2:

- Can someone answer their own question?
- What is the answer length limit?
- What about attachments? How many?
- Can pass answering any question?
- Can someone see others' answers?

### A3

- While waiting, can anyone edit their answers?

### EXTRA ideas:

- Submission order could be awarded - being quick, being verbose
- **Session-master**: ask questions, set theme, music, and moderate thread
